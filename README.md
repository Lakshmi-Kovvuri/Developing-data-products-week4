Introduction:

This presentation is the Developing data products week-4 assignment.

This course project has two parts:
 
 First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it in Rstudio's server.
 
 second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio presenter to prepare a reproducible
 pitch presentation about the application.
  
      In this Rmarkdown presentation, first I created a shiny application. Here I used diamonds dataset from the datasets package. 
      
  The dataset contains 53,940 observations of diamonds and 10 variables such as price, carat, cut, clarity, color, X,Y and so on.
  
  By using 'selectInput' and 'checkboxInput' option in sidebar panel of reproducible pitch, we can know the relationship between the attributes. 
      
  The reproducible pitch presentation is available in the following link:
